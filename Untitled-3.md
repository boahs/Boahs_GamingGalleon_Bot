2/4 respirators 0/3 medical bloodsets
1/4 fuel conditionors
1/5 OFZ shells 

STASH wi-fi camera in drug lab 
MARK Ms2000 marker on south east end (approach from north or die to MG probably)
find data in pumping station (south one) - top left door 
STASH SIGNAL JAMMER same building as data, operating room key - bottom right door 

best route for all four quests most likely go as north as possible, cross to road, make way south
down the road and be sure to look for rogues. STAY on the road though in fear of mines.
